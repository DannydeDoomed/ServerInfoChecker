# ServerInfoChecker
By selfhosting this PHP file somewhere you give yourself access to basic data that is transmitted by the line `enable-query: true` in your `server.properties` file. Although according to [some links](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties) it is disabled by default, but a lot of hosts (and sometimes panels themselves) have this enabled. This isn't an issue you can solve by a plugin such as DevHider.

It isn't necessarily bad to be able to read basic information but some servers are very strict about their plugins 'Please don't steal them because then you can steal our entire server!11!!1!1'
